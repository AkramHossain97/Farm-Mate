# Farm Mate - Android-App
Farm Mate is an Iot based smart poulty management product where the app is linked to the hardwere and gives realtime data updates to the user. The applicationâ€™s backend has been designed in such a way that depending on the environmental changes it will suggest the user to do certain tasks that will ensure optimal state of the system. The user can turn off or on the fan, light, exhaust fan, conveyor belt. The data has been saved to the firebase real-time database so every change in value happens in real-time. To ensure the latest state of the device, the application is checking the value every single minute.
